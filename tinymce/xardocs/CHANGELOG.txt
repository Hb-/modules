* Version 0.1.0
- Upgrade to TinyMCE 1.31
- Multiple bug fixes
- Ability to set number of Undo levels - better for performance
- Configuration for ensuring Inline styles using style="" rather than eg border=0
  This makes for XHTML 1.0 Strict compliance, and useful when the Class drop down box is not available
- Add the Special Labelled Only mode that only convert textareas of divs 
  labelled with the attribute: mce_editable = "true" 
- Known issue in IE on Windows when short URLS are used on a page where an editor
  instance is created or used to modify a document
  eg Comments creation to an article which uses short URLS.
  Temp workaround: 
  Either turn short URLs off for that module, Use "Ask" so the editor is not automatically 
  used for that specific textarea, or only add the template tags to specific module templates to
  restrict the editor instance.

* Version 0.0.3
- Upgrade to TinyMCE 1.30
- Added additional configuration options for advanced theme including location of editor toolbar
- Additional general options including configuration of language, removal of hardcoded themes, optional width 
of WYSIWYG editor.
- Moved all configuration to the Modify Config function. This passes the final javascript to the template for use
eliminating processing of config vars in the template.

* Version 0.0.2
- Upgarde to TinyMCD 1.26
Configuration options added in the module's Modify Config option in the Admin Panels.
This included theme choice, and specific options for Advanced theme use such as addition or removal of buttons,
use of a specific CSS style sheet.

* Version 0.0.1
Basic wrapper allowing installation as a module through Xaraya's module view listing (install, activate,
deactivate)
