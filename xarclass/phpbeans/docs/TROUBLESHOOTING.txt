TROUBLESHOOTING

Platform-Agnostic Issues:
- If your PEAR installation fails or misses packages, you can install them
  individually by downloading them from http://pear.php.net/ and running:
  cd /path/to/phpbeans/php; ./bin/pear install /path/to/package.tgz

Platform-Specific Issues:

Mac OS X
- Requires libtool14 and dlcompat-shlibs packages which are available through
  the Fink package management system (http://fink.sourceforge.net/)
