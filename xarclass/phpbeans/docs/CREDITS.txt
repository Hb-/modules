A very large portion of the code was taken from http://www.phpbeans.com. During
porting to PHP5 i changed so much of the original code and renamed so many things
it's arguably another (not necessarily better) product. The ideas from John Luxford
however, notably the local reconstruction of objects are still very much there 
though.
