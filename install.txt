Social bookmarking sites allow websurfers to save, catalog, and share interesting pages they find online. The Sociable plugin appends links for your readers to use those sites to the end of each of your blog’s posts, increasing your potential audience.

The mod was orginally made by http://push.cx/sociable

If you’d like to keep up with Sociable development, you can read the tagged posts on this blog (feed). Or just read all of this blog, I swear it’s so amazing you’ll be sneezing rainbows.
Download, Upgrading, Installation

just unzip files and upload it to blogroot/wp-content/plugins
To upgrade, first deactivate Sociable and remove the sociable directory, then follow the install instructions.

To install, unzip it, and upload the sociable folder (not just the files in it!) in your wp-contents/plugins folder. In your WordPress administration, go to the Plugins page to Activate the Sociable plugin and a subpage for Sociable will appear in your Options menu.

If you find any bugs or have any ideas, please mail me.

Advanced users: Sociable hooks the_content() and the_excerpt() to display without requiring theme editing. To heavily customize the display, use the admin panel to turn off the display on all pages, then add calls to your theme files:

 
// This is optional extra customization for advanced users
<?php print sociable_html(); ?> // all active sites
<?php print sociable_html(Array(‘Reddit’, ‘del.icio.us’)); ?> // only these sites if they are active
