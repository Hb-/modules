phpLDAPadmin roadmap

0.9.3 planned features:
	Bugfix release.
	This release will focus on fixing bugs, adding minor features, and improving stability.
	Samba 3.0 support in samba user and machine creation templates
	Move template config to a new config file: template_config.php (or something)

0.9.4 planned features:
	Complete i18n. All strings localized.
	Add mass-update feature (user provides filter and set of attrs/vals to modify)
	No-schema mode of operation (some servers simply won't give us schema. This becomes a problem for normal operation)
	Search filter builder for simple search form (just select AND or OR for a group of criteria)
	Modification templates 
		user
		oragnizationalUnit
		posixGroup (view full DNs and browse buttons)
		sambaUser (v 2 and 3)
		sambaMachine
	http auth_type (a la phpMyAdmin)
	read-only attributes (similar to hidden attributes) in config
	Support and test ActiveDirectory and iMail LDAP schema.
	Support for modifying replica entries (using ldap_set_rebind_proc())
	Add blowfish encryption to encrypt cookie-stored passwords and DNs.
	Default mod template: Add a "browse" button for attributes that store DNs.
	Add output buffering when including lang files so no output is sent to the browser (which could cause problems for sessions and cookies)
	Add a random hint on the welcome page
	Paging search results.
	Anonymous binds redirect to search page with no tree viewer (as an option in config)
	Remove all HTML from language files.

0.9.5 planned features:
	Hidden/read-only attrs on a filter-basis (ie, different users have different viewable, writable	attributes)
	Seious compatibility testing for additional LDAP servers.
	Configuration for templates.
	Template instances with unique config.
	Object Oriented migration for server and general configuration (ie, add a class Server)
