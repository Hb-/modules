These instructions assume that you have a working install of:
	a. A web server (Apache, IIS, etc).
	b. PHP (with LDAP support)

Installing phpLDAPAdmin in 4 easy steps:

1. Untar the archive (if you're reading this, you've already done that).
2. Put the resulting phpldapadmin directory somewhere in your webroot.
3. Copy 'config.php.example' to 'config.php' and edit to taste.
4. Then, point your browser to the phpldapadmin directory.

Browsers

phpLDAPAdmin was developed on Mozilla, and will most likely run best thereon.
However, testing has been done on Internet Explorer, and it should work
well also. No testing has been done on either Konqueror (or any khtml-based
browser like Safari) or Opera. If you find a browser incompatibility,
please report it.
