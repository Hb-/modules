Using this module in a production environment can be a bit of a challenge. Producing
PDF files in itself is in its early days (dynamically on the web, that is) and
using this module on different platforms without changes to the code can be daunting.

This file documents some of the experiences during customer implementations, but let 
me start by explaining something about the module, so you can determine whether
it is for you or not.

The basic design is very simple:

1. Take a XSL:FO + XAR template
2. run that through fop
3. deliver the output.



* the setting to compress output by the zlib handler in php.ini can dramatically
slow down the delivery of the PDF. Especially since this application is more often
used on an intranet than on a public server, I found turning that setting off gave
me better results.

* there is lots of confusion on what type of headers to use when pushing the
PDF to the client, especially if your audience uses internet explorer. I havent
been able to find a pattern which worked for me in all types of situations. I plan
to add some sort of configuration section to the module so the user has more control
over the delivery.
