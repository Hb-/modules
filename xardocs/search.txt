Search and Sort Implementation
==============================

Search is conducted on either one of the following :

1. Alphakeys
2. General search box
3. Categories

In addition there is sorting of fields according to asc or desc alpha order
on a given active field (4).

1. Alphakeys
-------------
Click on any alpha key, and all items with the nominated default key field
as first letter will display.

Users can sort asc or desc on any active field on the result set.

2. General Search
----------------
Any string entered into the general search box will return a result set
of items containing that string in any of the nominated active fields.

Users can sort asc or desc on any active field on the result set.

3. Categories
--------------
Users can select one or more categories to 'or' then in selection of a member.
A member item is returned if it is allocated to one or more of the selected categories.

Base categories are not considered in the search and deemed 'empty' category selection.

Users can sort asc or desc on any active field on the result set.


4.Sort function:
--------------
1. Sort order is implemented by clicking on field header of table
2. The search result set will remain selected when sort order is changed.
3. If and only if the field is the same on the next click, the sort order will change on that field
4. If an alpha key is selected, the sort order and field for sorting will remain the same
   until another field header is clicked
5. Sort order will be retained over multiple pages if pager is implemented
