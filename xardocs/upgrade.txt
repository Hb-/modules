Upgrading to Sitecontact 1.1.0
==============================

You must be on at least version 0.6.1 of Sitecontact to upgrade to this version.

If possible, test the upgrade and template changes on your local development
copy of your site. You can prepare the changed templates in advance and update
them to your live site at the time you upgrade your module. The changes are
provided here in detail making them look a little more extensive than what they
really are.


Critical changes that may cause module to fail if not completed are marked.
Changes marked as important are required to ensure you get the fixed or improved
functionality. Other changes are code efficiency or tidy changes, and may
improve display output. For best results diff your custom templates against the
corresponding new Sitecontact template.

Steps
=====

1. Please delete your old Sitecontact module, and replace with the Sitecontact
   1.1.0 module (this assumes you have any customized templates or files in your
   theme). In your site in the Administration Module Listing, upgrade and then
   activate the module.

2. If you have custom email templates:
   a. Critical change - rename any email templates that you have customized per
      form, to use a hyphen(-) rather than an underscore(_) between the main
      template and the form name eg user-usermail-html-myform.xt rather than
      user-usermail-html_myform.xt

    b. Important change - All email forms (user, admin and both html and text)
       were revised for content and if possible, you should use a good diff
       application to copy over the new changes to your customized templates.

3.  In your custom or form specific user-main.xt template:
    a. Critical change - ensure you change contactus.php to respond.php in the
    form tag. The contactus.php function is now deprecated and respond.php is
    the function the form submits to.
    
    b. Important change - Compare the new user-main.xd template at the point and
    your customized template. Note where username and useremail input tags are
    added. If you are using these fields, ensure you have the new
    <xar:set /> and <xar:data-input /> tags and their content. For the
    useremail, ensure you have the line with :
    
            <span class="xar-error">#$invalid['useremail']#</span>
            
    c. Critical change - Ensure you have all the template code in the new
    user-main.xd template between the comments "Dynamic Data properties input"
    and "Dynamic Data properties input -end" added to your template to replace
    existing DD property input.

    d. Important change - Ensure you have all the template code in the new
    user-main.xd template between the comments "Start captcha support "
    and "End captcha support" added to your template to replace any existing
    formcaptcha template code.

4.  A new user-result.xd template exists that is displayed to the user on
    successful fom submission. You can override this to form a custom page as
    is, or for a specific form by appending the form name in the usual way
    see the module Overview).
