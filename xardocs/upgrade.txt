!!! IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPGRADES FROM NETQUERY VERSION 3.3 & EARLIER !!!

Because this version of Netquery uses a revised Whois data table structure, you
may get a lot of confusing error messages if you don't use the correct upgrade
procedural sequence.  (Although no real harm is done, Xaraya gets especially
upset if older Netquery blocks are left active during the process.) So, to avoid
scaring yourself to death, please proceed as follows:

1) For all CMS editions (Postnuke, Xaraya and Xoops) any Netquery side blocks
should be disbled and the module deactivated BEFORE the new files are uploaded
to the server.  For the Xoops edition, the existing module version must be
uninstalled completely so the data table can be upgraded by the new version.

2) Upload the new files to your server, or upload the Netquery ZIP or GZ package
and extract the files on the server.  It is always safer to delete all of the
old version files first, rather than relying on overwrites.

3) For the standalone edition, just let nqsetup run as usual and it will upgrade
data tables as required.  For the Postnuke and Xaraya editions, run the normal
module update process from the CMS admin control panel and then re-activate the
module and any blocks.  For the Xoops and PHP-Fusion editions, this Netquery
version must be installed as if it were a new module, and then run the normal
Xoops module update process and reactivate any blocks as desired.

4) For the Xoops and PHP-Fusion editions, you will also need to re-install the
port services and/or GeoIP data tables by selecting those "Install Data" options
in the main Netquery admin configuration panel as desired.
