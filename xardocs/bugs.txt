KNOWN BUGS

* Photoshare is unable to detect whether or not the GD function
  ImageCreateTrueColor exists and some versions of PHP may crash without any
  trace of what happend when the function is called.

  To avoid this you should have GD version 2.0 or newer installed as well as
  PHP should be at least of version 4.0.6. If this cannot be done then find
  the following lines in "pnuserapi.php":

      // If the check for imagecreatetruecolor fails then insert the next line
    // $hasTrueColorImage = false;

  Then insert the second line (remove the two leading slashes

  Signs: Photoshare stops and leaves the screen blank after image upload.
