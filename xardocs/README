Xaraya Vanilla Module
=====================

In short, this module will simultaneously log a user into a local installation
of Vanilla Forums as they log in and out of Xaraya. As much as possible has
been made automatic, and there is virtually no configuration involved.

The local Vanilla installation should be located in a sub-directory of the Xaraya
install. 'forums' is a good choice. Other folders should also work, so long as
the installations are on the same domain so that Vanilla cookies can be set by
Xaraya.

When you log into Xaraya, if the user does not exist in Vanilla, then one will be
created *provided* the user in the member of a group that exists on Vanilla.

Each time a user logs in, the groups they are a member of will be compared to
the groups available on Vanilla. If any of the group names are the same, then the
user will be added to that role. If a user is removed from a role on Xaraya, then
they will also be removed from that role on Vanilla. This way you can add users to
banned roles etc. to disable their Vanilla use.

By default Vanilla will support a single role for any user. This module will select
the matching role with the highest 'priority' in Vanilla, i.e. the role with the
highest privileges. However, if the 'MultiRoles' plugin is installed in Vanilla,
then this module will also use that to add as many additional matching roles as
it can, so a user can have multiple roles in Vanilla.

The user login created on Vanilla will be the string 'user_' followed by the 
Xaraya user ID. That username is the primary key used to keep the users between
the two systems in sync.

The passwords are randomly set, so there is no way a user can manually log into
Vanilla using their auto-generated username. To be safe, new user registrations
and manual login should be disabled in Vanilla, as should be the ability to
change passwords, e-mail addresses and usernames. The users can change any other
detail though, so can maintain a different display name and profile information
on Vanilla.

There is just admin screen for this module. This screen provides some basic checks
and may make some recommendations if some of the settings need to be changed.

The script 'custlogout.php' located in this module, may need to be copied to the
root folder of Vanilla. So far in my tests this has not been necessary, but I
suspect some stricter security settings on the PHP installation may make this
required in some installations.

It only leaves me to say: have fun with this module and with Vanilla forums.

Additional Notes
================

Here are some additional notes for setting up the pair (Vanilla and Xaraya).

The following options should be added to conf/settings.php:

$Configuration['ALLOW_EMAIL_CHANGE'] = '0';
$Configuration['ALLOW_NAME_CHANGE'] = '0';
$Configuration['ALLOW_PASSWORD_CHANGE'] = '0';

The administrator roles need to be renamed. Xaraya names the administrator 
role as 'Administrators' while Vanilla uses 'Administrator'. You should change
one or the other so they match. I generally add an 's' to the end of the
Vanilla administrator role.

You will probably want to change some of the other role and group names too,
e.g. change Xaraya 'Users' to 'Members', or vice-versa on Vanilla.

TODO:

We need to prevent people from registering and from directly authenticating
themselves on Vanilla. It is not yet very clear how to do that.
