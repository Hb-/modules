This module provides full authentication control of dotProject from within the Xaraya environment, for
dotProject version 2.0 and later.

It also provides an alternate, HTTP authentication system.

To install:

1. Copy the xarDPLink directory and its sub-directories into your Xaraya modules directory.

2. In System Admin -> System Configuration of DotProject, select 'postnuke' as the login_authentication
method.

3. From Xaraya, login as an administrator and go to Modules administration.  Regenerate the list and
then Install (and Activate) the xarDPLink module.

4. From administration, administer the xarDPLink module to set the full URL to your dotproject
installation.  It is suggested that you include the http:// part in your URL, otherwise Xaraya may
use a URL relative to its location.

5. Users can login directly from the link in the user menu.


Usage:

Provided you are logged into Xaraya, and you have access to the dotProject menu item, clicking the link
will start dotProject with your Xaraya credentials.
If you have not chosen Full Window in xarDPLink admin then it will appear within the center block of your
Xaraya site.

If you do not have a valid login on dotProject, one will be created for you with your current postNuke
login, password and full name.  This new login will have the Anonymous role assigned, giving read-only
access to dotProject.

If you have an existing login on dotProject, it will simply update the password and full name (if necessary)
and log you in with whatever permissions you already have.
