Things TODO for workflow module:

Generic:
* Object Oriented stuff, the current style is not exactly neat. It's a port of something else, and it shows.
* loop protection: if there is a process which has a set 
  of activities which are autorouted and non-interactive (easy to spot
  in small processes, but sometimes harder in bigger ones) there may
  be an infinite loop, which will very quickly fill up the database
  with workitems. 
  Detection of these loops is a known NP complete problem unless we 
  specifically implement a detector (the looping as such can be
  intended within the same instance, so it's not enough to detect on
  instance) Perhaps a detector that for each activity a 'trace' can be
  checked with a list of activities that has been run since the last
  time we were at that specific activity. The check could then be to
  have at least 1 interactive activity in that trace.
* code and template editing: tis a joke now. A big help would be to
  'link' the code or template to an area where they can be managed
  manually outside the web-interface. Another is to improve the web
  interface and use a 'php-edit' component and a 'template-edit'
  component, which both would be useful in the grander scheme of
  things for Xaraya as well.
* the dependency on GraphViz is a bit problematic, consider adding SVG generation 
* Add a class for Transitions

Xaraya specific:
* this module is a dream for ajax fans, let them loose on it :-)
* do the export as a Blocklayout formulation
* ditto for SVG graph generation.
* current itemtypes: active processes. Think about this for a bit.
