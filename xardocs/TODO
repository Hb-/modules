Things TODO for workflow module:

Generic:
* loop protection: if there is a process which has a set 
  of activities which are autorouted and non-interactive (easy to spot
  in small processes, but sometimes harder in bigger ones) there may
  be an infinite loop, which will very quickly fill up the database
  with workitems. 
  Detection of these loops is a known NP complete problem unless we 
  specifically implement a detector (the looping as such can be
  intented within the same instance, so it's not enough to detect on
  instance) Perhaps a detector that for each activity a 'trace' can be
  checked with a list of activities that has been run since the last
  time we were at that specific activity. The check could then be to
  have at least 1 interactive activity in that trace.
