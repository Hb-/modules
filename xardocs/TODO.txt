General TODO
============

o Installer:
- Create tables [done]
- Create DD objects [done]
- Create module variables (or use config file)

o Add 'contact name' to events [done]
o Add 'locking flags' to events to lock them from external updates
o Show warning when editing if an event is managed externally
o Create config page for settings, or perhaps just drive settings from a config file?

o Display flags on events, where relevant:
- Cancelled
- New
- Recently updated
- Featured
- Sold out/No places left
- Provisional dates flag

o When updating events, transform html and text fields to ensure they are the right format

o Provide administration screens for viewing submitted events (for approving or rejecting)

o Provide some kind of subscription service

o Complete export types
- Fix iCal export encoding
- Create vCal export
- CSV export
- Text export
- iCal XML export

o Create a 'build yourself a feed' page, with a URL that can be copied and pasted (iCal, vCal, RSS).
  The feed will use only the predefined date ranges to keep the URL short.

o Complete privileges (I suspect some bits are not fully protected) [done - I think]

o RSS template (to copy to the RSS theme) [done]

o On modify/create event screen, display the appropriate buttons
- No buttons if nothing to submit (but do provide 'cancel' if there is a return URL)
- If only have comment privileges, then there is no point redirecting to the 'edit' or 'show'
  pages because the event will not be available to that user

o Easy plug-in system for handling hooks to events (e.g. links to travel organisers based on postcode)

o Short URLs! Can't forget short URLs.

o Implement proper fulltext search when MySQL is detected.

o Show categories as proper hierarchy in jump menu. [done]

o Keep running total of event counts over various date ranges (days, weeks, months, years)
  for easy and faset use in calendar displays. Needs to be kept regularly refreshed, without
  adding substantial extra load to a page.
