Various stuff to do:

- Import/export (itemtypes and items, with hook data, esp. DD)
- Sample page types and pages (use the import function for this)
- A screen to give sample mod_rewrite rules to support the config (i.e. to
  remove the index.php/[xarpages] part of the path; if provided  by an API
  then a trigger or hook could be developed to automatically update
  mod_rewrite rules each time the pages are changed
- Creation of sample blocks - a crumb-trail, a CSS menu etc.
- A site map example page
- Have a really good think about how to implement searches. This won't be
  easy as each page type could get its data from a different place, and this
  module has no inside knowledge of how to access that data - am tempted not
  to do this, but to use an external search engine on the rendered pages
- Some good docs with examples and diagrams
- Fix page view so that the image on the first item displays correctly - it
  is currently displayed as an empty root node regardless of whether it has
  children
- Completely templatize the selection of images in the tree view
- Provide selection methods (by tree etc) on the admin/view page to help
  view large numbers of pages
- Provide selection box when there is more than one template page for a
  given page type (possibly including -none- as an option) - when creating
  a new page
- Cache the page details so that they can be used by blocks
- Implement customisable page template as well as item template field to
  the page
- Nicer error when an attempt is made to create a duplicate page type;
  currently the user gets a complex database error

- Privileges (registered, but not yet actually used) - DONE
- Overview of module in the 'admin/main' template - DONE
- Write a module delete/remove function - DONE
- Allow page status to be changed recursively - DONE
- Sample functions (perhaps handling a publication type and categories) - DONE


To get this thing working in the meantime, create a page type called 'html'
and set up a DD column for it called 'body' - a large textarea field would
be good. Create pages and away you go :-)
