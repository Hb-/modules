General TODO
============

o Installer:
- Create tables
- Create DD objects
- Create module variables (or use config file)

o Add 'contact name' to events
o Add 'locking flags' to events to lock them from external updates
o Create config page for settings, or perhaps just drive settings from a config file?

o Display flags on events, where relevant:
- Cancelled
- New
- Recently updated
- Featured
- Sold out/No places left
- Provisional dates flag

o When updating events, transform html and text fields to ensure they are the right format

o Complete export types
- Fix iCal export encoding
- Create vCal export
- CSV export
- Text export
- iCal XML export

o Complete privileges (I suspect some bits are not fully protected)

o RSS template (to copy to the RSS theme)
