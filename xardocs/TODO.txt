Various stuff to do:

- Privileges (registered, but not yet actually used)
- Import/export (itemtypes and items, with hook data, esp. DD)
- Sample page types and pages (use the import function for this)
- Sample functions (perhaps handling a publication type and categories)
- A screen to give sample mod_rewrite rules to support the config (i.e. to
  remove the index.php/[xarpages] part of the path.
- Creation of sample blocks - a crumb-trail, a CSS menu etc.
- A site map example page
- Write a module delete/remove function
- Have a really good think about how to implement searches. This won't be
  easy as each page type could get its data from a different place, and this
  module has no inside knowledge of how to access that data
- Some good docs with examples and diagrams


To get this thing working in the meantime, create a page type called 'html'
and set up a DD column for it called 'body' - a large textarea field would
be good. Create pages and away you go.
