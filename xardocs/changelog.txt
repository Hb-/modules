Version 1.3 26th October 2003
   - rework of pubsub operation and tables

* pubsub_events : contains the (module + itemtype + cid) combinations
                      to which (at least some) users have subscribed.
  New records are created when necessary, based on the subscription of users.
  The unique identifier for the events is the 'eventid'.

* pubsub_reg : contains the (eventid + userid) combinations for user
                   registrations. 
  New records are created when users subscribe to a particular "event".
  The unique identifier for the subscriptions is the 'pubsubid'.

* pubsub_process : contains the (pubsub_id + object_id + template_id) combinations
                       for any notification jobs that need to be processed by the
                       by the processq() function.
  New records are created when a create/update/delete hook is called, and users are
  subscribed to that particular "event". This is handled by the processevent() function.
  The unique identifier for the jobs is the 'id'.

* pubsub_templates : contains the different templates to be used to notify users
                         when an event was found in a create/update/delete hook call.
  The unique identifier for the templates is the 'id'.
