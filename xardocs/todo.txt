1. Add 'TrackBack' functionality
2. Finish up permissions layout
3. Finish comment activation/deactivation scheme
4. pagination
5. Add collapseable/expandable threads -- do this in prune_excessdepth()
6. Simplify the options-bar
7. fix the author display on flat-view when user is posting anonymously
8. Add the ability to dissallow specific users from posting anonymously












Changes:

Fixed 'Post As Anonymous' such that, if the admin turns off the 'Allow Anon Posting'
option, all anonymous posts will not lose their anonymity. Prior to this fix, had the
Administrator turned off the 'Allow Anonymous Posting' option, any post that had previously
been set as 'Anonymous' would instead show the identity of the author. It will now only ever
show the identity of the author to moderators and above.
