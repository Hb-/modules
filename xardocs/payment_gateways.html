<blockquote><h3>To set up a new payment gateway, you need to do three things:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Write an API function similar to <strong>xaradminapi/authorizenet.php</strong> to connect to your payment gateway.  You should be able to find sample code in your payment gateway's developer documentation.</li>
<li>Add your payment gateway to the array in <strong>xaradminapi/gateways.php</strong>.</li>
<li>Add some code in <strong>xaradminapi/handlepgresponse.php</strong> to handle the response from your payment gateway.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes on payment gateways:</h3>

<p>Request a free <strong>Authorize.net</strong> test account: <a href="http://developer.authorize.net/testaccount/">http://developer.authorize.net/testaccount/</a></p>

<p><strong>PayPal</strong>... go here:  <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/">https://developer.paypal.com/</a>
Click the US or UK link next to Create a Website Payments Pro account.  I tested with US.</p>

<p><strong>PaySimple</strong> is almost integrated but I have little more work to do on that.  They are a reseller of <strong>USA ePay</strong> so that integration should work for all other resellers.</p>

<p>Of the three, <strong>Authorize.net</strong> was the easiest to get started with.</p>
