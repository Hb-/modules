<ol>
<li>Write an API function similar to <strong>xaradminapi/authorizenet.php</strong> to connect to your payment gateway.  You should be able to find sample code in your payment gateway's developer documentation.</li>
<li>Add your payment gateway to the array in <strong>xaradminapi/gateways.php</strong>.</li>
<li>Add some code in <strong>xaradminapi/handlepgresponse.php</strong> to handle the response from your payment gateway.</li>
