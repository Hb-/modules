MAJOR CHANGES
*************
See the changelog.txt in the xardocs directory or at http://xarigami.com/contrails/versions/xtm.


IMAGE BROWSER (IBROWSER), IMAGE MANAGER (IMANAGER) and  SECURITY
******************************
The updated xartinymce ibrowser and image manager plugin can be downloaded at http://xarigami.com

Please make sure you copy the tinymceconfig.inc.php file in
modules/tinymce/xartemplates/includes/tinymceconfig.inc.php to your
var/tinymce/ directory and update the configuration settings there.

Most settings will work as is, but you must set the image libraries to your own.

Using ibrowser, imanager means that the path to your images will be available to those
browsing your site. If you want obfuscated paths and file names, please use the Xaraya Uploads module.

For added security, turn off Upload ability in the filebrowser, or the iBrowser and iManager plugins and 
use the Uploads and Images module. Point your Image library to the Image module's directory or 
trusted directory of Uploads.
