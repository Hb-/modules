Description
---------------
The Highlight module houses a transform hook that performs syntax highlighting
on programming code.  Highlighting is accomplished by the GeSHi utility (see
credits.txt).  Code that is to be highlighted is marked by a special attribute
in any block-level HTML tag (see Usage).


Installation
---------------
This module is installed in the standard Xaraya way!
1. Upload files to the modules directory
2. Go to Modules Admin and initialize the module
3. Go to Highlight Admin => Modify Config and enter an attribute name
4. Enable Highlight hooks in whatever content is desired


Usage
---------------
The Highlight hook will ONLY transform segments of your content that are
contained in an HTML tag that has the attribute specified in Modify Config.
The attribute's value must be a coding language listed on Highlight's
Admin => Languages page.  So, for example, say your attribute name is set to
code' and you want to highlight some PHP code.  The segment in your article
must be labeled:

    <pre code="php">
    if ($pears == "bartlett") {
        echo "Yummy!";
    }
    </pre>
