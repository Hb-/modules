Description
---------------
The eBulletin module is an increasingly robust email newsletter system that
exclusively uses Blocklayout to generate newsletters using content that's
already on your site.  This gives you the power of determining exactly what
content is included and how it is formatted.


Dependencies
---------------
mail (regid 771) - sending newsletters


Upgrading
---------------
Many things changed in the 0.9.7 release.  There is unfortunately no upgrade
option, and you will have to completely uninstall the old module BEFORE
upgrading to the new.  When you have removed all of the prior version's
database tables AND files (you can keep your custom templates, though), then
follow the Installation instructions below.


Installation
---------------
Module installation begins in the standard Xaraya way:
1. Upload files to the modules directory
2. Go to Modules Admin and initialize the module

But there are few couple more things:
3. Decide where you want to store your templates.  Make sure that folder exists
   and is readable by the web server.
4. Configure the module by going to Files Admin => Modify Config.  Enter
   your preferred template directory.  This is where eBulletin will look
   when it needs to give you a list of templates.
5. Create templates for your newsletter(s) and if necessary a separate theme
   to go along with it.  See contrib/sample.xd for an example.  This file
   includes further description on template usage.


Usage
---------------
See eBulletin Admin -> Overview for usage details.  See contrib/sample.xd for
more template documentation.
