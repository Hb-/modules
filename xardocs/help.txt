Description
---------------
The Files module parallels file managing tools most commonly seen in cPanel and
other web hosting administrative interfaces.  It is intended for groups such as
project committees and executive boards to make file swapping easy for people
who are not proficient users of FTP, SFTP, etc.


Dependencies
---------------
mime (regid 999) - getting mimetypes and mime images for each file


Installation
---------------
Module installation begins in the standard Xaraya way:
1. Upload files to the modules directory
2. Go to Modules Admin and initialize the module

But there are a couple more things:
3. Configure the module by going to Files Admin => Modify Config.  Enter
   your preferred archive directory.  This will act as the "root" directory;
   files above this level will NOT be accessible through this module.
4. Create and/or set the permissions of your archive directory so it is
   writable by the web server.

And some optional but STRONGLY RECOMMENDED things:
5. Make mime thumbnails prettier! (See contrib/README.)
6. Go to Privileges and/or Roles Admin and make sure everyone has
   acceptable levels of access.  Files module obeys standard masks!


Usage
---------------
Use the tabs and file pager to navigate, and to perform the desired functions.
