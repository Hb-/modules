All Netquery download packages include two zipped sets of query selector button
images (blue and grey) and eight CSS stylesheets (one for each button set for each
of the four Netquery standalone and CMS environments).

Stylesheet selection is an administrator option in Netquery's configuration panel.
You can use the CSS files provided as examples to create your own stylesheets.  If
you do, they must be located in the same Netquery styles subfolder to be listed with
the other options for selection.
