This module can be used to manage courses.

Terminology:
*course: a set of lessons with one theme. A course must be given a unique code, and can be planned.
*planned course: an occurence of one particular course

There is at this moment (0.1.4) no mechanism to group courses in an educational plan. 
This is performed by the separate module 'ITSP' (will be developed for this)

INSTALLATION

Make sure you have categories and keywords installed.
Copy all the files in /courses to modules/courses
Go to admin>modules>view all to install the courses module.
Go to dynamic data to import the courses tables for the course parameters
Admin>Dynamic Data>Utilities>Meta definitions
Choose the tables studstatus, courselevel and courseyear
Import them one by one
Adjust the properties of these objects so they are managed by courses and have the correct itemtype number

GENERAL USE
Adjust the course parameters. All of these need at least one item in them
Levels can be intermediate, starter
Year can be 2005-2006
Status can be enrolled, passed, failed.

Create a course. This basic item in the module is the basis.
Then, after creation, you can add an occurence of the course.
So when you will have an annual course "basics of PHP" you can add a planning for each year.
This is called a planned course

Students can enroll when there are enough seats available and when the date to enroll is not surpassed.

At the admin>planning page you can see the amount of students for each planned course
You can adjust these students there as well (change their status).

Courses have teachers. These teachers get access to classlists and get to edit the courses text.
