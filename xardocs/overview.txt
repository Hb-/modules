This module can be used to manage courses.

Terminology:
*course: a set of lessons with one theme. A course must be given a unique code, and can be planned.
*planned course: an occurence of one particular course

There is at this moment (0.3.0) no mechanism to group courses in an educational plan.
This is performed by the separate module 'ITSP' (will be developed for this) with id 572

INSTALLATION

Make sure you have categories and keywords installed.
Copy all the files in /courses to modules/courses
Go to admin>modules>view all to install the courses module.

GENERAL USE
Create course types
Adjust the course parameters. There are preset values at install, all of these need at least one item in them

Create a course. This basic item in the module is the basis.
Then, after creation, you can add an occurence of the course.
So when you will have an annual course "basics of PHP" you can add a planning for each year.
This is called a planned course

Students can enroll when there are enough seats available and when the date to enroll is not surpassed.

At the admin>planning page you can see the amount of students for each planned course
You can adjust these students there as well (change their status).

Courses have teachers. These teachers get access to classlists and get to edit the courses text.
