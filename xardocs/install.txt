Installation
---------------
1. Extract and upload files under /modules directory (/netquery subdirectory).
2. Install as usual from the modules page of the Xaraya admin panel.
3. Use Xaraya's blocks admin to add one or more Netquery blocks if desired.
4. Open Netquery's admin panel and configure features to be available to users.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Netquery's local ping and traceroute features require read/execute permission
  for your system's ping and traceroute executables.  The logging feature
  requires write permission for the log file.
- If you have included the optional GeoIP and/or ports services and exploits data
  packages, be sure to select the "Install Data" options for those features and
  follow the on-screen instructions.
- All packages include two image sets of query selector buttons and several CSS
  stylesheets selectable as an admin option.  You can also "roll your own" CSS
  stylesheets.  Please see styles.txt for additonal important notes for Xaraya.

That's it -- enjoy!
