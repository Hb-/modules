Thanks to:

Advent HOPE Sabbath School
    (The organization whose emailing needs got me thinking about newsletters
    for Xaraya in the first place.)

Web hosts Site5, IX Webhosting, Lunarpages, and others
    (Whose half-baked mailing list configuration tools and limited options
    drove me to seek a better solution)

Richard Cave
    (Who wrote the first Newsletter module for Xaraya.  My newsletter needs
    necessitated a module with a whole different architecture, though I
    borrowed a number of his ideas initially.)


Changes to version 1.2.x
