Scheduler How-to

To use calendar alerts, you must setup the scheduler module to execute
email_alerts.

Once you have Scheduler installed, go to the modify config page and set the
module to "julian", the type to "user", the API Function to
"email_alerts", and the interval to "every day".

The Trigger will depend on your server configuration. There are basically
two choices.  Use the Cron scheduler or use webcron.(http://webcron.org)

Using Cron:
Set trigger type to "External Scheduler", Source to "IP Address(direct
connection)", and type in the ip address of the machine with the cron job on
it. Then you will need to add a cron entry into your cronntab file that will
hit the webpage listed above the Source on the configuration page. (I used 
wget to hit my webpage)

Troubleshooting:
If you get "Wrong trigger" when you click on the web page link, something
isn't configured right with the Source. (bad ip address or can't resolve
hostname)
