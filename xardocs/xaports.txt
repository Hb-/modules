Ports table updates downloaded from http://www.virtech.org/tools/
will work with Netquery v2.x and later. Simply replace the existing
source files (xaports.php and xaports2.php) and select the Build New
Table option in the Netquery administrator's main configuration panel.

Please note that building a new table involves replacing all data in
both the port services table and its related category flags table.
Unless it has been backed up, all of the previously entered data will
be lost.

Data for the port services table and updates is provided courtesy of
Colin Tinker, Nick Cross and other contributors at g1gsw.org.
