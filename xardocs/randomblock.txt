Random Verse Block
------------------------------

This block displays random Bible verses that can be rotated on the following
intervals:

  - Every time a page loads (resource intensive!)
  - Hourly
  - Daily
  - Biweekly
  - Monthly

Verses are chosen from a list in the block's configuration.  Multiple query
lines are permitted.  Query lines are in the following format:

  [text]|query[|comment]

   where bracketed items are optional and "query" can be a reference such as
   "john 1:1" or a keyword search such as "baptism".

If no text is specified, the first available Bible text [as results from the
getall() API function] will be used.  If a comment is specified, it will appear
along with the verse when the block is displayed.


Multiple Passages, Tight Control
------------------------------
To choose from a tightly controlled list of passages, enter one query line for
each passage:

  KJV|rev 14:6-7|First angel's message
  |rom 2:28-29|Who is really a Jew, anyway?
  YLT|jn 1:1
  etc...

Multiple Verses, Loose Control
------------------------------
To display random verses from a single query, enter one query line:
  WEB|prov

This will randomly choose verses from Proverbs using the installed WEB Bible
version.  Note that specifying more than one line such as this will NOT cause
a random selection of a single verse across multiple books or texts.  It will
be treated as in the "Multiple Passages, Tight Control" section and show the
ENTIRE BOOK in your block at once.


Single Passage, All The Time
------------------------------
Just entering a single query line is NOT sufficient if your passage contains
multiple verses.  To display one passage all of the time, enter it twice:

  KJV|jn 1:1-3
  KJV|jn 1:1-3

This switches the block into picking one or the other line randomly.  But
since they're the same, it will always display the same thing!

You may also want to specify the Monthly rotation interval to minimize system
resource usage.


Known Bugs and TODO
------------------------------
Previously issues with this block are believed to have been solved.  It is now
believed to be sufficiently stable so as to not cause major errors or have
display issues.  Even so, I am trying to think of a better way to specify
passage lists and offer more flexibility (such as if you want a sequential
display of verses instead of a random selection all the time).
