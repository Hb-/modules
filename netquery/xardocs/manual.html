<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>The Netquery toolkit of network information utilities includes Whois lookups, DNS queries, server
port checking, HTTP requests, ICMP pings, traceroutes and Looking Glass router interrogation. Each
feature can be enabled or disabled individually by the administrator. Local execution and/or a
remote server script can be used for the ping and traceroute features and are fully configurable.
The administrator can also configure all entries in the whois and looking glass data tables to add,
edit and delete Whois server/TLD associations and to specify both default and router-specific settings
for looking glass feature execution.</p>

<blockquote>DOWNLOAD NOTES:<br />
(1) Windows downloads of .tar.gz files may get renamed with .tar.tar extensions. The downloaded file
itself will be okay; it just needs to be renamed back to tar.gz at your end. (This happens because
Apache servers flag ALL files ending in .tar, .tgz and .tar.gz as mime type "application/x-tar" and
Windows thinks they should be renamed accordingly. One of those cases where two wrongs definitely
do not make a right.)<br />
(2) Only the Netquery standalone download contains basic administrator login authentication of its
own. (The CMS editions rely upon module security provided by the CMS.) If you want to control user
access for the standalone edition, PHP open source authentication add-ons are readily available,
including <a href="http://www.beanbug.net/">vAuthenticate</a> and
<a href="http://www.xaviermedia.com/">CookieProtection</a>.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="whatfor">What Can Netquery Do For Me?</a></h2>

<p>Netquery has been designed and developed with site administrators, hosting service providers and
other technically inclined users clearly in mind.  In particular, every effort has been made to keep
administrative tasks such as module installation and configuration as easy and intuitive as possible
taking into account the wide range of hosted sites and dedicated server environments in which it may
be used.</p>

<p>Netquery can certainly provide site administrators and technicians with readily available and highly
useful information about their ISP performance and their Internet environment generally. But it's
<b>not</b> just for "network nerds".  Ordinary users of your web site can also benefit from access to
Netquery's functions and features. In particular, perhaps, the ability to view their own Internet
connection from the downstream ("outside-in") direction is especially useful to your end users as that
is the routing they depend on most.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered who owns that disturbing web site that your child stumbled upon while
browsing, and would you like to have some accurate contact information to complain about its lack of
COPA protections?  Or maybe you've joined the rapidly growing world of "always connected" Internet
access and are concerned about whether your newly bought "firewall" software really has closed all of
the entry ports to your system. Perhaps you're an ardent gamer who worries about "lag times" and
would like to know where those game-losing extra milliseconds are coming from.  Netquery can answer
all those questions and more.  Read on.<p>
<h2><a name="startup">Getting Started</a></h2>

<p>Getting started with Netquery is about as easy as anything could possibly be.  Just install it and
take a quick look at its pre-set admin options to see if you want to change any of them.  Depending
on which package you downloaded, options will be pre-configured for UNIX/Linux systems (the .tar.gz
download) or for Microsoft Windows systems (the .zip download).  Of course, either package can be
reconfigured to suit your needs and preferences.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the set-up steps and all available administrative options.</p>

<h2><a name="adminnotes">Administrator Items</a></h2>

<p>In many cases, unless you need to use other external scripts or have special path requirements, you
won't need to change any configuration settings. <b>However</b>, unless you run your own web server and
can set permissions on its system executables, you will probably need to disable the local execution ping
and traceroute features. Very few hosting services allow the read/execute permissions required for those
local functions. A listing of alternative server scripts for use with the external traceroute and ping
features can be found at <a href="http://www.traceroute.org/" target="_blank">Traceroute.org</a></p>

<p>When Netquery is initially installed, its whois and looking glass data tables contain only a few
commonly used examples. To assist with populating your whois data table, you can look for TLD server
information at <a href="http://www.internic.net/whois.html" target="_blank">Internic</a> which contains
the integrated database of all the global top level domains.  You may also wish to refer to the
<a href="http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm">IANA</a> list of country registrars.  To assist with
populating the looking glass data table you can find lists of routers at
<a href="http://www.nanog.org/lookingglass.html" target="_blank">Nanog.org</a> and at
<a href="http://www.bgp4.net/cgi-bin/bgp4wiki.cgi?Route_Server_Wiki" target="_blank">Bgp4.net</a>.</p>

<p>Because Netquery's looking glass configuration provides both default and individual router settings
it is important to understand their order of operational precedence.  For entered items (username,
password, daemon port, daemon password) individual daemon passwords take precedence over the user
password and individual router entries take precedence over the default configuration entries.
(For example, leaving a router's "bgpd port" entry blank (or set to zero) means that the default "bgpd
port" entry will be used.) For enabled/disabled items, disabling the main configuration item disables
it for all routers. (For example, if "Use bgpd" has been enabled (checked) in the main configuration
for looking glass, it can be disabled for an individual router, but NOT vice versa.)</p>

<h2><a name="using">Using Netquery</a></h2>

<p>It is beyond this manual's scope to provide a complete background course on the Internet itself and
on the entire range of issues involved in examining various aspects of its complex structure, topology
and day-to-day operations. Instead, we'll focus here on actual usage and application of Netquery's
"looking glass" tools and we'll include a few useful links to other documentation for those who might
like to pursue some of the underlying issues in greater depth.  Let it suffice to say that the better
one understands those issues and their impacts on both service providers and end users, the more useful
Netquery becomes.</p>

<h3><a name="whois">Whois Lookups</a></h3>
<p>All domain names on the Internet are registered with "domain name registrars".  Domain name
registrars are entities which have been allocated the authority to register names for a specific
subset of domain names. Most Domain name registrars provide a "whois" function, where you can ask
"whois domain.name" and they will tell you who has registered that domain name.</p>

<p>Netquery's whois lookup feature provides to the user the same information that has been provided
by the owner of the site domain in question to the top level domain (TLD) registrar. To use it, simply
enter the name of the site domain (without any "www." or other prefix) and select the TLD (e.g., ".com")
from the available drop-down listing.</p>

<p>The drop-down TLD listing and associated whois lookup server data is fully under the control of
the Netquery administrator who may add, delete and change entries to suit his/her web site's purposes
and its users. If you don't find the TLD you're looking for in the available drop-down listing, you can
ask this site's administrator to add it.</p>

<a href="http://www.icann.org/" target="_blank">ICANN</a></p>

<h3><a name="whoisip">Whois IP Lookups</a></h3>
<p>This Netquery feature provides owner-registrar information on a particular IP address, useful
when you do not have the domain information needed to use the Whois Lookup feature described above.
<p>More info:
<a href="http://www.arin.net/whois/" target="_blank">ARIN</a></p>

<h3><a name="dnslookup">DNS Lookups</a></h3>
<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. This system is used to associate a domain name
(e.g. www.mydomainname.com) with one or multiple IP addresses. Now, an IP (Internet Protocol) address
is like a phone number to a computer. Every computer has one but just like a phone number, sometimes
an IP address can be hard to remember. This is why there is DNS. Instead of having to remember,
216.226.138.60 we only have to remember www.simplehost.com.</p>

<p>The domain registrar from whom a domain name is purchased will assign two IP addresses to that domain
name. These IP addresses are the primary and secondary name servers which are responsible for propagating,
on the Internet, that domain name and its associated IP address.</p>

<p>Netquery can provide users with both forward and reverse DNS resolutions. If the user enters a domain
name, it will be resolved to its IP address.  If the user enters an IP address, it will be resolved to its
domain name, if one has been allocated and propagated for that IP address.

<a href="http://www.insan.co.id/tutor.eng/dns.html" target="_blank">tutor</a></p>

<h3><a name="dnsdig">DNS Dig Queries</a></h3>
<p>Netquery's Dig tool is available only on web sites that run on UNIX/Linux servers. Microsoft Windows
servers do not support this feature.  Where available, it provides essentially the same functionality
as the DNS lookup feature, but uses the UNIX/Linux command set to execute the actual function.</p>

<h3><a name="port">Port Checks</a></h3>
<p>Port checks can be an important part of securing your computing system, especially for those who
operate with "always connected" (cable, ADSL, etc) Internet services. To use this Netquery feature,
simply enter the host address and port number you wish to check and the results will tell you whether
it is open and accepting connections.</p>

<h3><a name="port">HTTP Requests</a></h3>
<p>Hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) is the languange used by web browsers and web servers to
communicate with and respond to each other across the internet.  Using this function, you can
send an HTTP request (HEAD or GET) directly to a server specifying a particular object with a
complete URL and examine the server's response "in the raw".</p>
<p>More info:
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2068.html" target="_blank">RFC2068</a></p>

<h3><a name="ping">ICMP Pings</a></h3>
<p>As its name suggests, the ping feature can be compared to a submariner's sonar. It is a utility
that simply checks whether the target computer is currently connected to the internet and responding.
You should be aware that some servers (e.g., microsoft.com) are deliberately configured so that they
do not respond to ICMP pings.</p>

<h3><a name="traceroute">Traceroutes</a></h3>
<p>Traceroute can be used to show you how a site is physically connected to the Internet.  Along the
way you will also gain an understanding of how networks inter-connect. Traceroute can be used to
determine the specific network route taken to reach a specific remote host.</p>

<p>In a simplified way, this is how traceroute works. Every IP packet can specify how many hops it
can go through before it is no longer forwarded on. When a packet is no longer forwarded on, that
router just forgets all about it, but it also will usually send out a message to the source host saying,
"Hey, sorry, but your packet died here." So, traceroute cleverly manipulates these values so that the
first round of packets it sends out to the designated host are specified such that they can only go
through one hop before dying. So that first hop gets those packets, sees that it's not supposed to
forward them on any further and doesn't, and then sends a message back to the source host telling it
that the packets died. When traceroute receives the "your packets died here" message from the router,
it knows that's the first hop. It then sends on the second round of packets specifying that they can
only go through TWO hops, and the cycle continues. It finishes when it gets a response from the final
destination. For each hop, traceroute then displays the RTT, Round Trip Time, or the time difference
between when the probe was sent from traceroute and the time the response arrived for each packet.</p>

<h3><a name="port">Looking Glass</a></h3>
<p>Looking glass extends Netquery's scope by providing capabilities for interrogating routers (Cisco,
Zebra, Juniper) used in wide area networks that comprise the Internet. It is intended for advanced
users who have an in-depth understanding of network topology and router functions. The looking glass
feature in Netquery contains the following commands for both IPv4 and IPv6: OSPF neighborship,
BGP neighborship, OSPF RT, BGP RR, Zebra Any RR, and Zebra Interface Info.</p>
