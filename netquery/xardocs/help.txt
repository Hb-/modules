Installation
---------------
1. Extract and upload files under /modules directory (/netquery subdirectory).
2. Install as usual from the modules page of the Xaraya admin panel.
3. Open Netquery's admin panel and configure features to be available to users.
---------------
IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Netquery's local ping and traceroute features require read/execute permission
  for your system's ping and traceroute executables.  The logging feature
  requires write permission for the log file.
- If the administrator wishes to display services and exploits data for the
  Port Check feature, its "Build New Table" option must be run once.  Updates
  for the xaports.php and xaports2.php files will be available from time to time
  on the http://www.virtech.org/tools/ page.

That's it -- enjoy!
