It is very easy to change the default "My Card" images on your payment page.

    
    1. upload the images to 'includes/templates/template_default/images/icons/'
    2. log in to your carts admin
    3. chose 'Configuration' > 'Credit Cards'
    4. enable all of the cards you plan on supporting by selecting the card and changing its value to 1
    5. enable the images by selecting 'Show on Payment' by changing its value to 2

That's it, done.

Notes: BankCard Australia is no longer active and should not be enabled (taken from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankcard_(credit_card)). 

"The National Australia Bank was offering replacement accounts to its Bankcard customers, duplicating the features (annual fee, interest rate, etc.) of the old accounts with a special Visa card. All National Bankcard accounts were transferred or closed by 19 May, 2006. The Commonwealth Bank has stated that it would convert all existing Bankcard card holders to either a MasterCard or a Visa card by 31 October 2006. Other banks were expected to follow suit during 2006.

Merchants within Australia were able to accept Bankcards up to, and including, 31 December 2006. Starting 1 January 2007, Bankcard would no longer be accepted by any merchant.

Bankcard operations were closed in New Zealand during October 2005.

As at September 2007, the bankcard website is non-existent."

Switch is no longer active (taken from Wikipedia [irrelevancies omitted]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_(debit_card)). The logo for cc8 remains for those who process with Switch. It can be substituted with card of choice, rename it to cc8.gif

"Switch is a former debit card in the United Kingdom [omit].

The brand was merged with Maestro, an international debit card brand owned by MasterCard Worldwide, in 2002. [omit] However, despite the Maestro brand name, transactions in the UK are still processed by Switch Card Services Limited. Consequently many retailers who advertise that they accept Maestro can only accept UK-issued cards, i.e. former Switch cards.[omit]"

Cirrus and PayPal were added as alternatives. As Zen-Card still validates against the older, now defunct Australian and Switch bank cards. Substituting logos is not recommended. Editing the payment pages directly, at your own risk, is the recommended way to post card logos outside of the Zen-cart accepted scripts. AS ALWAYS, MAKE BACKUPS BEFORE YOU EDIT PAGES!
