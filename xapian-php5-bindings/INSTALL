To compile and install enter the following commands.

phpize
./configure
make
sudo make isntall

NOTE: After running phpize you may need to edit a line or two of the 
Makefile. 
 
Make sure that the line that starts with CXX looks like this:
    CXX = g++

And 
    EXTRA_LDFLAGS = -lstdc++ -lxapian 

That should be all the editing you will have to do.  We have tested 
these bindings on RHE4 and Ubuntu 5.10 with php5.

Please let us know if you have any problems with these bindings. Enjoy.
