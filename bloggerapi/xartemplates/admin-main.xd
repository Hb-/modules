<h1>Overview of the Blogger API</h1>

<p>
  The Blogger API is a XML-RPC API used for blogging. The API is very simple and is 
  basically a way to exchange strings between xmlrpc clients and servers.
</p>
<p>In Xaraya the webservices module is responsible for providing the xmlrpc transport
  needed for the Blogger API functionality. This module will not function without
  the webservices module activated.
</p>

<p>
  You can find the specification of the Blogger API at

<h1>Little survival guide for using Blogging tools with Xaraya</h1>
<p>
  Make sure you have enabled the following modules:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Webservices</li>
  <li>Categories</li>
  <li>Articles</li>
</ul>

<p>
  When these modules are activated, configure the categories modules and create some
  categories which should hold the postings made from Blogs. While not necessary, it 
  is adviced to create a publication type for blog postings specifically and link this
  type to the category-tree you created for blog postings.
</p>
<p>
  Go into the config section of the BloggerAPI module and configure the publication type
  to use for blog postings. Select either News articles or your publication type which 
  you created.
</p>
<p>
  Basically you're all set now to start blogging. Use your favorite tool for managing your
  blog postings. For windows we recommend <a href="http://www.bloggar.com">w.bloggar</a> and
  for other operating systems <a href="http://mozblog.mozdev.org">The mozilla blogger</a>. 
  These two are the ones we test the API with and make sure that it at least works with those.
</p>
<p>
  Point your blogging client to the url: http://www.yourxaraya.com/ws.php?type=xmlrpc and use
  your Xaraya account for authentication. The rest should be self-explanatory.
