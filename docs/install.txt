WHAT IS IT?
-----------
Window is a Xaraya module that enables virtually any web content such as
html, scripts (home pages, galleries, shopping carts, php, perl, asp, etc.) to
be easily incorporated into your Xaraya site.  Just call the Window module
with any URL and it will display it in your Xaraya main area/window. I call it
a content wrapper (takes any existing content anywhere and wraps your Xaraya
site around it. Uses an <iframe> which must be supported by the browser and
JavaScript to resize the <iframe>.


INSTALLATION
------------
- Unzip to your modules/ directory to create the window/ subdirectory.
- In the Xaraya admin menu go to Modules, View All.
- Check the Regenerate checkbox and click on Reload.
- Go to Window and click on Initialise.


ADMINISTRATION
--------------
The following options can be set from the Window Administration menu.

    GENERAL SETTINGS
The General settings page defines overall settings for the Window module.

- Display off-site pages, controls whether pages not on your local domain or
server can be displayed.
- Use buffering of output before sending, buffers the page output.
- Use compressed output, uses compressed output from the server.
- Allow input from browser address bar, determines whether the user can enter
the url in the browser address bar.
- Compare URL against URL Security, activates URL checking from the URL Security
page. Otherwise, any page can be displayed if it is not restricted by the other
settings.
- Only for registered users, determines whether a user must be registered and
logged in to see the Window page.
- Add link for Open in new window, adds a link to open a new window above and
below the page.  If one of these links is clicked, the content is opened in a
new browser window.
- Use fixed title, displays a fixed title above and below the page.
- Auto resize window, uses JavaScript to resize the content window.
- Length of viewing window in pixels, is the length of the window that will
contain the page.  This value will only be used if Auto resize window = No.
- Width of viewing window in pixels or percent, is the width of the window that will
contain the page. Default is 100%

    URL SPECIFIC SETTINGS
If Compare URL against URL Security = Yes in the General settings, then any URL
must be entered here in order to be displayed.

- Add, adds a new URL and alias (either can be used to display the page)
- Edit, edits an existing URL entry
- Delete, deletes an existing URL entry

The following are the same as the General section but override the General
setting for the specific URL.

- Only for registered users
- Add link for Open in new window
- Use fixed title
- Auto resize window
- Length of viewing window in pixels


HOW DO I USE IT?
----------------
Just call Window in module fashion with the page variable set to the URL or
location that you want to display in Xaraya. If Compare URL against URL
Security = Yes, then you may use either the URL or the alias that you defined.
For example, an anchor would look like:

URL:    <a href="index.php?module=window&page=index.php">My Site</a>

Alias:  <a href="index.php?module=window&page=mysite">My Site</a>

    Or in a Generic Menu Block:

URL:    index.php?module=window&file=index&page=index.php
Alias:  index.php?module=window&file=index&page=mysite


    Cool! For a remote site you would use:

URL:    <a href="index.php?module=window&page=http://www.xaraya.com/">Xaraya Site</a>

Alias:  <a href="index.php?module=window&page=xaraya">Xaraya Site</a>

    Or in a Generic Menu Block:

URL:    index.php?module=window&page=http://www.xaraya.com/

Alias:  index.php?module=window&page=xaraya

And you'll show the Xaraya home page in your main window.

    URL OPTIONS
There are several variables that can be included in the URL that will override the
settings in General Settings:

- The height (vertical size) of the iframe in pixels can be set using &height=
- The width (horizontal size) of the iframe in pixels or percent can be set using &width=
- Auto resize of the page can be set with &resize=1 (this will override the height value if set)
- The page title can be set using &title=

Example:

index.php?module=window&page=http://www.xaraya.com/&height=1000&width=90%

index.php?module=window&page=http://www.xaraya.com/&resize=1

index.php?module=window&page=http://www.xaraya.com/&title=.....make it your choice

Example:

index.php?module=window&page=http://www.xaraya.com/&index=1


WHERE TO USE IT
---------------
You can place references in your user home page, linked to the main menu or to
sub menus, on user pages and just about anywhere.  You can use hrefs <img srcs,
Javascript dynamic page generation, html redirection, and even php scripts by
sending Location: headers.

The real magic is that other applications written in php or perl or Javascript
or whatever run as if they were a part of Xaraya, seamlessly and with little
effort. If you do this, be sure to give proper credit though. As long as it is
pleasant looking running standalone, it will look great running in Xaraya via
Window.
