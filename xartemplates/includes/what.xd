  XORBA is <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAFLA">yafla</a></em> for Xaraya Object Request Broker Architecture. It takes the ideas
  and some of the code from <a href="http://phpbeans.com">phpbeans.com</a> and
  applies them to Xaraya. The module includes the following parts:
  <ol>
    <li>an implementation of a protocol server, i.e. letting a Xaraya instance run as a daemon supporting on or more 
          protocols (currently only the protocol described at phpbeans.com is implemented)</li>
    <li>a management interface in the module to manage a running XORBA server (be it the same xaraya install or a remote one)</li>
    <li>a command line phpBeans client (to access a XORBA server from the commandline)</li>
  </ol>
  This may sound complicating, and it can be, so here's a picture:

  </div>
</p>
<p>
  The elements in the picture can be all inside one Xaraya install or be spread out over many installations. The crux of the idea is
  that it allows (authenticated) clients to use php Objects available to them from a remote location and use them as if they were local
    (syntax-wise) but the object methods will run at the remote location.
</p>
  The XORBA objects are persistent; the server stores them in an object store. They are then available for retrieval at any 
  later time, not directly limited by session or page request. Obviously the user requesting them should have the proper permissions 
    to access the object.
</p>
<p>
    For Xaraya specifically, assuming an instance of Xaraya runs as the XORBA server, this allows client programs to use Xaraya
    objects from a remote location. This example gets more interesting when the client is also a Xaraya installation, the usage of objects can
    be almost transparent in that situation, meaning that it is not directly apparent where the code would run, just by looking at the code.
