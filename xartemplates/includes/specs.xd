    Rather than duplicating the information here, the phpbeans.com site has
    3 excellent pages describing the protocal, server API and the client API.
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://phpbeans.com/index/spec_protocol">Protocol specification</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://phpbeans.com/index/spec_server_api">Server API specification</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://phpbeans.com/index/spec_client_api">Client API specification</a></li>
    </ul>

<h5>Compatibility issues</h5>
    Several changes were made to the original php code, mostly to make everything PHP 5
    compatible and take advantage of the newer Object model in PHP 5. 
    The following changes are relevant for client and or server developers:
    <ul>
        <li>PROTOCOL CHANGE:
          instead of the 'one-off' SEND: user/pass to authenticate, the XORBA server treats the
          'anonymous' user as any other user. Meaning that when the host access rule allows it
          the user anonymous can connect and use (probably a limited set of) objects. Clients can
          use the 'auth' object to elevate their identity by identifying with a user/pass combo.
          In code this would be: 
          <pre>
              $auth=$client->getObject('auth');
              $auth->identify('user','pass');
          </pre>
          This also means the server does not send the <code>identify</code> response at connect
          time anymore. The rationale behind this change is to make the protocol even more simple
          than it already was and delegate usage of the server to Beans as soon as possible. It also
          makes anonymous usage possible and the protocol more internally consistent.
          The 'server' and 'auth' Beans can be viewed as system beans which will need to be present
          in almost any case (you still can use the server without those beans, it means you wont
          be able to authenticate and cant query the server on the objects it serves, but otherwise it will
          be fully functional.)
        </li>
    </ul>
