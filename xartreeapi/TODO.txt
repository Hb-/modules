
- Item up/down (within a single tree only - with removable stops at least)
- Move item (to any branch, with an appropriate rebuild)

- Delete item (with option to recursively remove descendants)

- Various queries:
  - Parent
  - Siblings
  - Ancestors
  - Descendants
  - Next sibling
  - etc.
