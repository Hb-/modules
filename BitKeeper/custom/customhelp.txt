Overview(sum)	       Custom bitkeeper commands manual 	 Overview(sum)



NAME
       Overview - Summary of the custom command system

DESCRIPTION
       The  custom  command  system allows developers to extend bitkeeper with
       their own commands. The system is organized in the spirit of BitKeeper,
       meaning	that the custom commands can be used in the same way as normal
       BitKeeper commands:

       bk <global-options> customcmd <cmd-options>


       A plain vanilla BitKeeper installation has a number of places in  which
       it looks for commands:

       - internally

       - in the bk.script file (macro like functionality)

       - in the path


       The custom command system adds a number of things to the command execu-
       tion logic:

       - it searches in the /BitKeeper/custom directory for executable scripts

       - the scripts in this directory are in the repository so they are  ver-
       sion controlled and will be propagated on pulls and pushes

       - a bk chelp and bk chelptool command which contains help pages for the
       custom commands.


       The help system documents the custom  commands  implemented,  discusses
       the  architecture  of  the  system  and contains instructions on how to
       develop your own custom commands.

addcomment(1)	       Custom bitkeeper commands manual 	 addcomment(1)



NAME
       bk addcomment -	add propagatable comment for <file>

SYNTAX
       bk addcomment [-y"<comment>"] <file>


DESCRIPTION
       The  bk	addcomment command creates a comment for the file specified by
       <file>. This commands does not have the limitation of the  bk  comments
       command that comments are not propagated.

       To establish this, the command creates a delta on the file  and commits
       a changeset which is specifically for the comment added	to  the  file.
       This  command  can be helpful for implementing a review system directly
       in bk or having this command as a part of a custom bk application which
       needs a commenting function on specific content.

       With  the  normal  bk  commands or the web interface these comments can
       easily be viewed.

OPTIONS
       -y<comments>
	      Specify the comments on the command line instead of  letting  bk
	      ask for it.

       <file> The filename for which the comments should be added.

FILES
       /BitKeeper/custom/addcomment


EXAMPLES
       bk addcomment -y "This comment added" testfile.txt

       Adds the comment "This comment added" for the file "testfile.txt"

archdeleted(1)	       Custom bitkeeper commands manual 	archdeleted(1)



NAME
       bk archdeleted - archives deleted files and add them to gone file

SYNTAX
       bk archdeleted -m <monthnr>


DESCRIPTION
       The   bk  archdeleted  command  archives  deleted  files  in  the  Bit-
       Keeper/deleted folder into a tar.gz archive and adds the files  to  the
       gone file.

       Once  the  gone	file  is committed and propagated other developers can
       simply issue a bk rmgone command to physically delete the  files  which
       are  in the gone file. It's generally a good idea to keep deleted files
       some time around. The -m specifier can be used to archive the files  in
       a  certain month in the current year. The repository manager can decide
       which files can be archived.  For  example  by  keeping	deleted  files
       around for two months or so.


OPTIONS
       -f<monthnr>
	      Archive  deleted	files  which had their lates revision in month
	      lt;monthnr>.

FILES
       /BitKeeper/custom/archdeleted


EXAMPLES
       bk archdeleted -m 11

       Archives the deleted files which had their latest revision in  November
       of the current year.
