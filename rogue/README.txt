This is a minor update to fix some problems that have been cropping up, as well as to add a nice contribution from Tony Sherman to make the script compatible with sites running Multi-Site.

The only real changes that need to be made are in the database table names.  You now want to use the prefix that you're using for your site  e.g. change tracks --> nuke_tracks.

I also got rid of the header tags in favor of Postnuke standard classes.  This solves some problems for people running older browsers.

As I figure out what has changed in .71 I'll be making some additions to this script.  If you have any suggestions feel free to drop me a line.
