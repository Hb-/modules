<h1>Gallery Template</h1>

<img src="example.jpg" border="1" align="right">The Gallery template shows an album <i>and</i> it's immediate child
albums in a combined thumbnails/slideshow window. The top album is presented together with it's child albums in 
different tabs in the lower half. For each tab/album a list of the thumbnails in the album in presented and clicking
on one of these brings it to the main pane.

<h2>Setup</h2>

<ol>
<li>In order to publish a Gallery you must publish the top album <i>and</i> it's child albums.</li>
<li>The top album must of course have "Gallery" as it's default template. The child windows can have
    any template associated with them.</li>
<li>You should also hide the child albums from the main album list (do this in the album setup window).</li>
