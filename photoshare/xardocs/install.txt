INSTALLING PHOTOSHARE
---------------------

1) Copy the "photoshare" directory and all it's sub-directories into
   the PostNuke "modules" directory.

2) Go to PostNuke's admin page and find the "modules" setup. Here you
   regenerate the module list and then initialize and activate Photoshare.

3) Goto Photoshare's admin menu and make sure the settings are correct.

   > Decide whether you want images to be stored in files on the disc
     or directly in the database.

     YOU SHOULD NOT CHANGE THIS AFTER THE FIRST IMAGE HAS BEEN INSERTED!
     - if you do so, you won't be able to use the image from before the
       change (the images are although available when you switch back
       to the old mode).

   > If you choose to save images on disc then specify a file directory
     in which they should be stored. Photoshare uses *only* this directory
     and no sub-directories in it. MAKE SURE PHOTOSHARE (the webserver) HAS
     WRITE ACCESS TO THIS DIRECTORY.

     This directory SHOULD be outside the webserver's document root, if it
     is not, then your users will be able to access the files independently
     of your access permissions.

     If you have PHP's OPEN_BASEDIR enabled then the admin window will
     display this folder. You directories MUST reside somewhere below
     the OPEN_BASEDIR.

   > You must supply a valid file directory in which Photoshare can
     store it's temporary files. MAKE SURE PHOTOSHARE (the webserver) HAS
     WRITE ACCESS TO THIS DIRECTORY. This also applies if you store your
     images in the database.

   > Specify the size of your thumbnails (in pixels)

   > Specify maximum file size of a single image and the total sum allowed
     for a single user.

4) Permissions:

     Group          Component       Instance   Permission
     All groups     Photoshare::    .*         read
     Users          Photoshare::    .*         edit

   This will give all users access to viewing published albums, and "Editors"
   access to create albums.

5) The URL to editing in Photoshare is:

     http://somewhere/index.php?module=photoshare

   whereas the URL to the list of all albums is:

     http://somewhere/index.php?module=photoshare&func=viewallfolders

   You can also use [photoshare] in PN's menu - this leads to the folder index.



UPGRADING PHOTOSHARE FROM 1.0
-----------------------------

1) Backup 
   - your database.
   - your image files (if using images on disc instead of in database).
   - your modules/photoshare directory.
   - your themes/your_theme/styles/style.css if you added photoshare styles to
     it in last install.

2) If you made changes to Photoshare's default stylesheet then copy the 
   directory "modules/photoshare/themes/photoshare"
   to "modules/photoshare/themes/your_theme" and re-insert your changes in 
   the "styles.css" file.

3) Remove/delete/undo/whatever all your Photoshare related changes in your 
   theme's stylesheet (themes/your_theme/styles/style.css).

4) Go to PostNuke's admin page and find the "modules" setup. Here you
   regenerate the module list and then upgrade and activate Photoshare.
