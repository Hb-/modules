PERFORMANCE TUNING
------------------
Since Photoshare accesses the PostNuke group membership table each and every
time it verifies access to a certain image or folder you should add a
database index to that table.

Assuming your PostNuke table prefix is "PREFIX" then you should execute the
following SQL statement:

  alter table PREFIX_group_membership add index (pn_uid)
